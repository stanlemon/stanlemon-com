My name is Stan Lemon, I am a husband, dad, Steelers fan and software engineer.

I live with my wife and three kids in Indianapolis, Indiana. Â I studied Theology and Biblical Languages at Concordia University River Forest, where I received a Bachelor of Arts degree.  After college I took up software development and currently work as a Software Architect for [Salesforce](http://salesforce.com), working on [Pardot](http://pardot.com).  When I'm not working I enjoy spending time with my kids, reading Star Wars books and watching the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://steelers.com).

You can catch me every week with my friend [Jon Kohlmeir](http://jonkohlmeier.net/about/) on our podcast, [Life with a Twist of Lemon](http://twistoflemonpod.com). 

More about my professional background can be found at my [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/stanlemon).

You can find some of my projects over at [GitHub](http://github.com/stanlemon).

From time to time I post on [Twitter @stanlemon](http://twitter.com/stanlemon).

I also actively volunteer in several non profit organizations:
- CASA for Marion County with [Child Advocates](http://www.childadvocates.org)
- Financial Secretary at [St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Indianapolis, IN](https://www.stpetersindy.org)
- Treasurer & Board Member for the [Indiana District LCMS](https://in.lcms.org)
