Evelyn is the household donut connoisseur. She’s the one responsible for getting me out of bed early to go get donuts, and she also usually decides where to get the donuts. She’ll tell you the best donuts in Indianapolis are at Long’s Bakery, but that Jack’s Donuts is closer; and if you want one of the cinnamon twists they’re bigger at Jacks, but Long’s has the better cake donuts. She’s got it all down; this is her thing.

      <p>When I made my <a href="/2020/04/19/pizza-night-at-the-lemons/">Pizza Night at the Lemon's</a> post and video I mentioned I would share my red sauce (aka &quot;pizza&quot; sauce) recipe shortly thereafter. Well, here it is!  This recipe came about due to the difficulties my wife and I had finding a good pizza sauce for our pizza. Prior to this recipe we also never ate pasta, for similar reasons. It seemed like whenever we found a good sauce we would snatch up as much as the grocery store had and then it would disappear after that, leaving us to experiment and find a different brand.  Finally we were doing a stint with Blue Apron and came across a <a href="https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/three-cheese-calzones-with-broccoli-rabe-broccolini-tomato-sauce">Calzone recipe</a> that had a rather delightful sauce to it.  Blue Apron ships their seasoning packets already measured so we didn't know the composition other than the unknown aleppo pepper and italian seasoning (typically oregano, basil and rosemary). So we set out to reproduce this sauce, along with some modifications and came up with what follows. This is our red sauce, we use it for pizza, spaghetti and any other pasta dish we put together. The batch here is more then you need for pizza night, so you can either save the extra for next week or freeze it if you like, we've done both! Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1lb 12oz can of crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil (or enough to cover the bottom of the pan)</li>
<li>8 fresh garlic cloves</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon <a href="(https://amzn.to/2SsCdea)">aleppo pepper</a></li>
<li>1 teaspoon dry basil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dry oregano</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you don't have aleppo pepper that's ok, just skip it, <a href="https://amzn.to/2SsCdea">but consider ordering some for your spice cabinet</a>.</em></p>
<h4>Optional:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dash of cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon <a href="https://amzn.to/369n5bh">ground fennel</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Begin with a medium sized pot, like 2.5 Quarts, pour about 2 tablespoons of olive oil into it, or enough to provide nice coverage over the bottom of the hot. Heat on medium.  You'll know when the oil is hot enough because if you flick a drop of water at it, it will pop.</p>
<p>One the oil is hot take 8 cloves of freshly minced garlic and place into the oil. If you do not have fresh garlic you can use pre-minced garlic, and figure about two heaping teaspoons.</p>
<p>Let the garlic fry up for about about a minute or just until it turns golden brown.  Make sure you're constantly stirring it around while it fries.</p>
<p>Add 1/2 teaspoon of aleppo pepper, 1 teaspoon dry oregano and 1 teaspoon dry basil into the hot oil and fried garlic, stirring in continuously for about 30 seconds or when the oregano and basil begin to toast.</p>
<p>Add 1lb 12oz of crushed tomatoes (1 big can) to the hot oil, fried garlic and spices slowly so that it doesn't splatter back at you, stirring vigorously. Add 1/4 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and optionally a dash of cayenne pepper, and a 1/4 teaspoon of ground fennel.  Stir continuously for about 4 minutes, or until the sauce has been heated through.  You'll know it's heated when the sauce begins to pop.</p>
<p>Remove from heat and let it cool before applying to a pizza, or if serving with Pasta apply immediately. You can smooth the sauce out with an immersion blender, which might be desirable for certain dishes.</p>

      <p>As long as my wife and I have been married we've been making our own pizza, every Friday night. I grew up in a suburb of Chicago where pizza and Friday nights were pretty much synonymous. Ordering pizza from your local parlour was just what you did. For my family most Fridays we ordered pizza from Campagna's, which made a crispy and often very salty thin crust. Later in life we'd frequent Dominick's and then <a href="https://www.paljoeys.com">Pal Joey's</a>, which sadly is the only one of these restaurants still in business today.</p>
<p>It often surprises people to learn that even as a Chicago suburbanite, the pizza which you are most likely to associate with our fair city was not what I grew up on.  The flakey and buttery goodness of Chicago style deep dish that places like <a href="https://giordanos.com">Giordiano's</a> and <a href="https://www.ginoseast.com">Gino's East</a> made so popular was not something we ate regularly. In fact, in my hometown I don't even know of a place that served that style of pizza when I was growing up.  Chicago style pizza is far more diverse than the casserole-like pies where the sauce decorates the top, in fact it's the thinner version of Chicago style pizza that I grew up on every Friday night and still continue to love. Now don't get me wrong, deep dish is fantastic, that's just not the purpose of this post today.</p>
<p>When my wife Sara and I got married we immediately moved to the Northern side of Pittsburgh, where she started a new job. That first Friday together as a married couple I was left with an empty and hollow feeling as we struggled to find a pizza place for dinner. There's a place called Fox's Pizza that's pretty popular, but nothing about about it tasted right. For the first time in my life I didn't enjoy pizza night.  So we did what any young couple would do during a culinary crisis and we decided to make our own.</p>
<p>Sara used a recipe right out of the Kitchen Aid Mixer recipe book, and for years it was good enough. We struggled to find good sauce, but for awhile the local Shop'n Save had the best we could find, until they didn't. When we finally moved to Indiana I took up bread baking as a hobby and thus unleashed a series of experiments in pizza making to find the right process, ingredients and recipe for the pizza I wanted to eat. The experimentation became so intense that one week our family ate pizza every night of the week, each a different recipe. What I ultimately found was that no single recipe accomplished the texture and flavor I wanted, so eventually I started experimenting with ingredients and ratios.</p>
<p>Almost five years later pizza night is as much a tradition in our family as it was in mine at my folk's home in West Chicago; the only difference is that I make my pizza from scratch. It starts before lunch time when I mix up the dough, and concludes right after I'm done with work as I hand stretch and assemble our pizza. For a long time many of my friends have asked me to share my recipe, which is honestly quite simple. The process is more nuanced though, and as many times as I've tried to write it down nothing would do it justice quite like a video. So here we are. I am happy to share a complete walk through of the Lemon family pizza recipe. I hope you'll give it a shot at home, and I hope this video helps you out.</p>

<br />
<p>For this recipe you're going to need a scale, because all of my measurements are by weight. Weighing any recipe that you're baking guarantees consistency. When you measure by volume its easy to throw off the ratio of flour and water and that can really change how things come out.  So if you don't have a digital scale at home, <a href="https://amzn.to/3aw7Qd2">do yourself a solid and order one</a>, they're inexpensive and super valuable when baking.</p>
<p>I use a mixer to combine my ingredients, but you can absolutely do this by hand too. Combine all of the ingredients and work them together until you have a smooth dough. In my Kitchen Aide mixer I start at speed 1 for 1-2 minutes and then increase it to speed 2 for another 6-8 minutes. In total you're going to mix the dough for 8-10 minutes, but the important thing is the texture. If you're doing this by hand, try not to add too much additional flour from your work service to the dough. Gently work it, folding the dough over itself again and again until you get a smooth and consistent dough.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Active Yeast 9g</li>
<li>Water 372g</li>
<li>Olive Oil 18g</li>
<li>00 Flour 300g</li>
<li>All Purpose Flour 300g</li>
<li>Salt 12g</li>
</ul>
<p><em>See notes below for additional information on ingredients.</em></p>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>After you've combined the ingredients, divide the dough into two even balls. I used my scale to weigh them and make sure they're equal. Then place the dough balls onto a lightly floured plate, cover it with plastic wrap and place it into your fridge for 5-8 hours. During this time the dough will rise, but thanks to the refrigeration it'll rise a little bit slower and develop a richer flavor profile.</p>
<p>When it's cooking time start your oven at the hottest temperature you can set it to. In my house this is 550 degrees. If you have a baking stone or <a href="https://shop.bakingsteel.com/collections/steels/products/baking-steel-3-8">baking steel</a>, put it in the over before you turn it on.  You're going to want to let you oven warm for about an hour to make sure everything is as hot as you can get it. I'm a big fan of the baking steel, as it concentrates heat in your oven far better than a baking stone does. Bottom line is you want something super hot to slide your pizza on to.</p>
<p>After your oven has been heated for about an hour, take the dough out of the fridge. I like to give it 10 minutes or so to adjust to room temperature. Remove the plastic wrap, lightly flour the top and bottom (I like to use Semolina for the bottom) and begin hand stretching the dough by passing it from one hand to the other and letting gravity do the hard work. If you've never seen this technique before, check out the video.</p>
<p>Once your dough is stretched and shaped begin assembly. <em>I have sauce recipe I make from scratch that I'll share in a future video and post.</em> I use just mozzarella cheese on the top. You can try other cheeses, but remember I'm going for the pizza I grew up with in Chicago and on the thin crusts that's mozzarella (deep dish aficionados will recall that provolone is common in those recipes).</p>
<p>Transfer your pizza into your hot 550 degree oven and set a timer for 6 minutes. Your pizza will be done when that mozzarella begins to blister (the slightly brown glorious crunchiness that forms when cheese is cooked in the oven).  Pull the pizza out, transfer to a cooling rack and wait 5 minutes before cutting. Then enjoy!</p>
<p>When cutting a pizza I'm a big fan of the <a href="https://amzn.to/2x5SRc0">Kitchy</a> which is sharp, easy to use and a breeze to clean.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I highly recommend <a href="https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/saf-red-instant-yeast-16-oz">Saf Instant yeast</a>, this stuff just works. If you have Fleischman's that's ok, but next time you're out shopping keep an eye out for Saf.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3bI2rRG">00 flour</a> is what gives my pizza that pizza-parlour smell and flavor that is so distinct from other flour. It's highly refined and finely milled Italian flour, often used in making pasta, but really puts your pizza over the top.</li>
<li>I love <a href="https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/king-arthur-unbleached-all-purpose-flour-5-lb">King Arthur's All Purpose Flour</a>, most grocery stores sell this.</li>
<li>If you don't have or can't find 00 flour that's OK, you can substitute all purpose or bread flour. It'll taste different, but it won't be bad.</li>
<li>If you want to try something different, substitute the all purpose flour with 00 flour. You'll find the pizza to be a bit more chewy, so your mileage may vary.</li>
<li>Using bread flour in place of all purpose flour is totally fine, it'll produce a chewier crust generally.</li>
<li>I recommend using kosher salt, but if you don't have any normal table salt is fine too.</li>
<li>For a little bit of extra flavor you can add 3g of garlic powder directly to the dough. Most of the time I do this.</li>
<li>I recommend having some <a href="https://amzn.to/3cX82np">Semolina flour</a> on hand for the underside of your dough, it's coarser and will help you move the dough from your work surface into the oven.</li>
</ul>

      <hr>
      <p>After nine seasons 76 million people tuned into watch the last episode of the TV Show Seinfeld. That episode was a profound middle finger to the audience of Seinfeld, basically telling every dedicated fan that after all those years the show was pointless. It was an extremely polarizing episode, some loved it, some hated it. But 76 million viewers! Do you ever wonder how they came up with that number? Did NBC have some magical way of tracking every TV with a wire or antenna that tuned in for the finale? No, they did not. Instead they used statistical sampling to come up with that number. This is how most ratings and viewership &quot;estimates&quot; work; a company like Nielsen polls a set of people who are representative of the total viewership, and then they multiply it out. If you sample 1000 people, which is supposed to represent a 100 million human beings, you’re going to multiply it by 100,000 to get your best guess at the actual number of viewers. This sort of estimation in statistical analysis is hugely important in understanding what’s going on today with numbers about viruses like the flu and the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at influenza. You might have heard of some of these numbers: During the 2018 - 2019 season, 34,200 died from influenza in the United States. Meanwhile, as I write this on April 19, 2020, <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins</a> is reporting 39,090 deaths from the novel coronavirus in the United States. Ok, so at first glance perhaps the novel coronavirus is marginally worse than the flu, but is that an accurate statement?</p>
<p>A number is only as good to you as your understanding of where it came from. It’s like Seinfeld and the 76 million people who tuned in for what many (not me) have argued is one of the worse finales to a TV show ever aired. We already know that 76 million people were not polled about Seinfeld, and the same is actually true of the 34,200 deaths from the flu in the United States. This 34,200 number comes from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html">Center for Disease Control’s website</a>, and a lot of people miss <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/how-cdc-estimates.htm">the methodology the CDC used for coming up with this number</a>. If you click a little deeper into the site and read further you’ll see that the CDC uses a tool to estimate total deaths from reported deaths.[^1] <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/irv.12486">Here’s their summary to the method</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We used routinely collected surveillance data, outbreak field investigations, <strong>and proportions of people</strong> seeking health care from survey results to <strong>estimate</strong> the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, <strong>and deaths</strong> due to influenza during six influenza seasons (2010‐2011 through 2015‐2016). <em>(emphasis mine)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at these numbers for the state I live in, Indiana.  For the 2018 - 2019 season <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/flu_pneumonia_mortality/flu_pneumonia.htm">Indiana had 1,118 deaths from influenza</a> according to the CDC. It’s important to remember that the CDC does not actually do these tests in each state, rather they get their data from state health departments like the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH). ISDH reports to the CDC actual tests each week, and <a href="https://www.in.gov/isdh/22104.htm">you can view these reports online</a>. If you look at <a href="https://www.in.gov/isdh/files/Weekly%20Influenza%20Report-Week%2020-2018-2019.pdf">the last report of the flu season</a>, which stretches from October to May, you’ll see that there were 113 reported influenza deaths. These are deaths with actual lab tests confirming that the individual who died had influenza. At the same time though, the CDC reports an estimate of 1,118 flu deaths in Indiana, which is derived from the 113 tested deaths reported by Indiana’s health department using the method they described above. Remember, 113 is the confirmed test number (like Nielsen’s sampling of the viewership for the Seinfeld finale), and 1,118 is an estimate (like the 76 million viewers that tuned into the Seinfeld finale).</p>
<p>Most news sources are relying on data from <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins</a> (which uses CDC data) to report the number of deaths from the novel coronavirus in the United States. The data in these numbers are from confirmed lab tests of people who have died from the novel coronavirus. These are not estimates. So when you want to compare the flu and the novel coronavirus in Indiana, the 1,118 estimated deaths from the 2018 - 2019 flu season is not the right number to compare to <a href="https://www.in.gov/coronavirus/">Indiana’s current 562 confirmed deaths from the novel coronavirus</a>[^2], the 113 number is. Comparing 113 flu deaths to 562 novel coronavirus deaths is comparing confirmed lab tests against confirmed lab tests.</p>
<p>But of course it’s more complicated than that. Notice I’m not referencing the 2019 - 2020 flu numbers. The reason for this is that this year’s flu season is not actually over. Just like the novel coronavirus season, we’re in the middle of it so our confirmed tests are incomplete. They’re going to grow tomorrow and the next day and the day after that until the season for this virus concludes. Right now we don’t know how long that is, but we know that the 113 confirmed deaths spanned a 7 month window while the 562 novel coronavirus deaths only span about 2 months.</p>
<p>The estimated deaths from the flu of 1,118 were just under 10x higher than the confirmed deaths of 113. I have no way of knowing if that multiple will hold true for the novel coronavirus. I hope not. We’re certainly testing far more people for the novel coronavirus than we do for the flu. We won’t know estimated deaths until this virus has run its full course and the CDC can work up a methodology and complete their research. For the time being all we can do is compare confirmed tests, and those are certainly higher. The important thing here is to remember that you have to be comparing the right numbers. If those numbers are not sourced the same way then you can’t simply say one is worse because the number is higher.</p>
<p>None of this is intended to scare you. It’s intended to help you understand why statements like &quot;we lose more people from the seasonal flu&quot;[^3] are, at best, a misunderstanding of the underlying numbers and how we got them. I think it’s fair to say that the number of confirmed tests show that the novel coronavirus has a higher mortality rate than the flu. How much higher remains to be seen, and we probably won’t know until this is all over. Until that day, stay safe, please.</p>

<p>This mathematical “revelation” is not new or original, but I chose to write this after seeing friends and close family compare the flu and novel coronavirus. If you want a longer and more sophisticated analysis of the number conundrum check out this piece from late March in The Washington Post titled, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/27/those-covid-19-death-toll-figures-are-incomplete/">“Those covid-19 death figures are incomplete”</a>. Just make sure you read the article in its entirety, please.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a epidemiologist, nor a health care worker, nor a scientist. My only qualifications are that I can read and I once took a statistics class in High School.

<p><em>Footnotes:</em></p>
<p>[^1]: If you're wondering why the CDC reports an estimate rather than just raw test data think back to the last time you had the flu, or the time before that. Did you make it to the doctor? If you did, did they test you? The flu is common enough that many of us have had it a few times and we didn't necessarily get tested each time to confirm it. Doctor visits and tests both cost money and they can curb the decisions that we make, especially during seasons when the flu may not be as bad. Factor in those without health insurance or even those who are naturally averse to visiting the doctor (like my friend <a href="http://jonkohlmeier.net">Jon</a>) and the confirmed tests really only show us a portion of the picture. This is ultimately why the CDC does research beyond confirmed tests to come up with a more accurate representation of the impact of the flu on the United States. Even if the CDC wanted a 100% confirmed number they couldn't pull it off, it's just too hard to do in a country of 328 million people. It's the same challenge a company like Nielsen is trying to figure out how many people tuned in for the Seinfeld finale.</p>
<p>[^2]: This number is current as of 4/19/2020, and if you read this anytime after the day I published this article it will be wrong. This is really amazing when you stop and think about it. Prior to the novel coronavirus the state of Indiana reported stats for the flu weekly in a PDF. They had a fancy table, but that was really it. The novel coronavirus has forced state health departments like ISDH to step up their analytics game in a big way, now giving daily updates with all sorts of data segments to analyze. This is great, but it also factors into the challenge we face with data right now as so many media outlets historically have reported estimates rather than raw data.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Lately I’ve been writing a lot about personal finance, especially topics related to budgeting. Lots of people think we’re on the verge of a recession, but my eyes have been set solely on the NFL, where my favorite team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, are gearing up for a run at another Lombardi. I love football, and the idea of a players' strike is entirely disconcerting to me. So while the finance world is worrying about a recession, I’m worried about whether or not the 2021 season will get played.</p>
<p>CBS Sports posted an article this week citing communication from the NFL Players Association (via ESPN) and in it were ten <em>recommendations</em> for the players as they <em>budget</em> for a strike. At first I laughed, but then I thought hey these are actually pretty good (even the outlandish ones). Here are the ten items from <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nflpa-reportedly-sends-work-stoppage-guide-to-players-preps-for-possible-lockout/">that post on CBS Sports</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save at least half of each paycheck, if not more. If your current expenses are too high to save this much, you should look at ways to change your spending habits and reduce financial commitments.</li>
<li>Try cooking at home instead of eating out as much.</li>
<li>Designate one day a week as &quot;no spending day.&quot;</li>
<li>Take care of major home repairs now.</li>
<li>If you're in the market for a new home, consider renting instead of buying for now.</li>
<li>Find renters for your unoccupied homes or bedrooms.</li>
<li>Consider selling a car you have not driven in the past six months.</li>
<li>Avoid signing a long-term lease on any rental property that you rarely use.</li>
<li>Learn to say &quot;no&quot; -- or at least, &quot;not now&quot; -- to friends and family asking for money.</li>
<li>Consider selling clothes you have not worn in a year on Poshmark, Thredup or Tradesy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these seem ridiculous to the average Joe, like &quot;<em>Consider selling a car you have not driven in the past six months.</em>&quot;. Do normal people just have extra cars lying around? I think we might be surprised how many do!</p>
<p>Here's the gist of these talking points: Consider having less stuff, but whatever you do, don't spend <strong>all</strong> of your money!</p>
<p>This seems like it would be really hard to do for an NFL player with a deal yielding several million dollars a year, but NFL players are no more immune to the urge to <em>spend what we have</em> than the blue collar factory worker or the software engineer with a blog.</p>
<p>There's wisdom here amongst the absurdity. Eating out, buying more clothes than you can wear, over mortgaging yourself, these are all normal people problems. We need to plan for the good times as well as the bad. Not everyone can set aside half of their monthly paycheck, but they can set aside something. As the economy's future becomes less and less certain I find this advice from the NFLPA very timely and much more widely applicable.</p>
<p>That said, I hope there's a 2021 Steelers season!</p>
